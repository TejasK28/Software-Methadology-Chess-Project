# Chess Project

This is a simple chess project implemented in Java. It includes different pieces like Queen, King, Bishop, etc.

## Compilation

You can compile the Java files using the `javac` command. Here are some examples:

### Compile a specific piece

To compile a specific piece, like the Queen, use the following command:

```bash
javac chess/*.java chess/pieces/Queen.java
```

### Compile all pieces

To compile all the pieces, use the following command:

```bash
javac chess/*.java chess/pieces/*.java
```

### Compile PlayChess.java

To compile the `PlayChess.java` and `Chess.java` files, use the following command:

```bash
javac PlayChess.java Chess.java
```

## Running the game

After compiling the Java files, you can run the game using the `java` command. More instructions on how to run the game will be added soon.
